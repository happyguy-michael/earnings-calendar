## 2026-03-10 — Progress-Aware BackToTop with Celebration

**Inspiration:** 2026 UI trend article "Beyond the Glass: 7 Mobile UI Trends Defining 2026" — specifically the "Emotional Micro-interactions" trend: "In 2026, a button press is never just a button press. It is an event."

**What I built:**
- Complete reimagining of the BackToTop button as a progress-aware, celebratory experience:
  
  **Scroll Progress Ring:**
  - Circular SVG progress ring shows scroll position (0-100%)
  - Real-time updates as user scrolls through the page
  - Glowing blue gradient stroke with drop shadow
  - Dark track background that brightens on hover

  **Hover Reveal:**
  - Percentage text (e.g., "75%") fades in below the arrow on hover
  - Arrow lifts up to make room for the percentage
  - Smooth spring-based transitions

  **Celebration on Success:**
  - When scrolling completes and reaches top → confetti burst!
  - 12 particles explode outward in radial pattern
  - Color-coded particles (blue, green, amber, pink)
  - Haptic "success" feedback when celebration triggers

  **Haptic Integration:**
  - Medium haptic on click (tactile confirmation)
  - Success haptic when reaching top (reward feeling)

  **Premium Styling:**
  - Glassmorphic dark mode background
  - Ambient glow that intensifies on hover
  - Ripple effect on click
  - Full light mode support with inverted colors
  - Mobile-responsive (accounts for FAB menu offset)

**Technical details:**
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth scroll tracking
- Ref-based scroll-to-top detection for celebration trigger
- Integrates with existing `useHaptic` and `useMotionPreferences` hooks
- Full `prefers-reduced-motion` support (disables confetti, smooth scroll)
- ~300 lines of new CSS for v2 styling

**Impact:** What was a utilitarian "scroll up" button now becomes a delightful interaction. Users can see their scroll progress, get tactile feedback, and receive a tiny celebration when they reach the top. Makes scrolling feel rewarding.

## 2026-03-10 — SentimentPulse: Dynamic Earnings Momentum Indicator

**Inspiration:** Heart rate monitors, live trading dashboards, and market sentiment indicators. The goal was to create an organic, alive feeling that reflects the real-time mood of the market based on earnings results.

**What I built:**
- New `SentimentPulse` component with ECG-style waveform visualization:
  - Animated heartbeat that speeds up or slows down based on beat/miss ratio
  - Six sentiment states: hot (🔥), bullish (📈), neutral (➡️), bearish (📉), cold (❄️), waiting (⏳)

  - Dynamic narrative that adapts to today's situation:
    - "4 reports today — 2 pre-market, 2 after hours"
    - "AAPL already crushed it with +12% surprise"
    - "Quiet day — no earnings scheduled"
  - Six mood states: `hot`, `good`, `mixed`, `rough`, `waiting`, `calm`

## 2026-03-10 — Morphing Search Icon Animation

**Inspiration:** 2025 micro-animation trends for search bars (bricxlabs.com, expertappdevs.com) — morphing icons that transform on interaction, providing satisfying visual feedback during search activation.

**What I built:**
- Enhanced search icon with focus-triggered morphing animation:
  - Icon rotates -15° and scales 1.15x when search bar is focused
  - Subtle pulsing glow effect (2s loop) during active search mode
  - When user starts typing, icon settles to "active" state (no rotation, subtle glow)
  - Smooth spring-based transitions using `--spring-bouncy` timing

- Keyboard hint enhancements:
  - `/` key hint scales down and fades when focused (exit animation)
  - When keyboard shortcut is triggered, kbd shows "press" animation (scales to 0.85 then bounces back)
  - Periodic attention pulse (every 4s) on kbd hint to draw user attention
  - Animation disabled if reduced motion preference

- Light mode support:
  - Adjusted glow intensity for light backgrounds
  - Maintains visual impact without being harsh

**Technical details:**
- Uses CSS `filter: drop-shadow()` for the glow effect (works on SVG)
- Spring timing function for bouncy, satisfying feel
- State management in SearchBar component tracks `kbdTriggered` for animation trigger
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` - disables all transforms and animations

## 2026-03-10 — Premium Wave Shimmer for Skeleton Loading

**Inspiration:** 2025/2026 skeleton loading design trends (freefrontend.com, frontend-hero.com, matsimon.dev) — synchronized shimmer using `background-attachment: fixed`, multi-color brand-tinted gradients, and wave effects.

**What I built:**
- Upgraded skeleton shimmer from basic grayscale to premium brand-tinted effect:
  - Gradient now includes subtle blue/purple/pink highlights matching brand colors
  - Uses `background-attachment: fixed` so ALL skeleton elements shimmer in perfect sync across the viewport
  - Increased gradient size (400% vs 200%) for smoother wave effect
  - Smoother `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` timing at 2.4s duration
  - Added subtle `box-shadow: inset` for depth

- Light mode support:
  - Softer brand tint that works on light backgrounds
  - Maintains synchronized shimmer behavior

- Accessibility:
  - `prefers-reduced-motion` falls back to static subtle background (no animation)

**Technical details:**
- The `background-attachment: fixed` trick makes the gradient position relative to the viewport, not each element
- This creates a unified "wave washing over the page" effect instead of individual shimmer per element
- Brand colors at low opacity (6-12%) add visual interest without being distracting

**Impact:** Loading states now feel more premium and cohesive. The synchronized shimmer creates a polished, app-like experience that matches the brand aesthetic.

    - **Amber + ⚠**: Revenue diverged from EPS (mixed signals — e.g., EPS beat via cost cutting)
  - Hover tooltip explains the signal ("Both EPS and revenue beat — strong quarter")

**Technical details:**
- Animated entrance with configurable delay (staggers with other card elements)
- Tooltip with smooth fade/scale animation
- Graceful handling of missing revenue data (hides completely)
